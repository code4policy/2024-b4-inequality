            Populism is on the rise. Since 2000, there are now more than <strong> three times as many populist leaders in power </strong> around the world, claiming they represent the will of a country’s “true people.” Many populists use “us versus them” language, which contributes to polarization in political environments and erodes trust in mainstream politicians and trusted institutions.

    <p> In order to test whether a leader’s speech has elements of populism in it, we have trained an AI model based on the Tony Blair Institute’s text analysis methodology for detecting populism in speeches, and categorizing it by type.
