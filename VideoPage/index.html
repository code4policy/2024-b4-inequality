        Cultural populism claims that the “true people” are the ethnic or native members of the nation. This makes immigrants, religious minorities, cosmopolitan elites and anyone else with different values seen as a threat. Cultural populists often emphasize religious traditionalism, law and order, anti-immigration positions, and national sovereignty.

        Socio-economic populism lifts up the working class as the “true people.” This makes corporations, big businesses, capital owners, and international financial institutions the outsiders who are capitalizing on the working classes’ economic contributions.

        Anti-establishment populism claims that the “true people” are victims of a state run by special interests, with an emphasis on establishment elites as the primary enemy. These kinds of populists tend to emphasize issues like corruption, democratic reform, and transparency.

        For a detailed analysis, see "High Tide? Populism in Power 1990-2020" by the TB Institute (2020), available at TB Institute
